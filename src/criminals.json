These items included advanced testing equipment used in quantum computing, hypersonic missiles, nuclear weapons development, and other military and space-based military applications.\r\n \r\nSerniya’s clients included the National Research Nuclear University of the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute; the Ministry of Defense; the Foreign Intelligence Service (\"SVR\"); and various components of the Federal Security Service (\"FSB\"), Russia's principal security agency and the main successor agency to the Soviet Union's KGB.\r\n \r\nLivshits allegedly controlled several American and international front companies that operated on behalf of the Serniya Network. These entities conducted no actual business and were allegedly used to obfuscate the role of Russian or sanctioned entities in transactions with American and Western technology companies. Livshits allegedly facilitated the financing and smuggling of tens of thousands of controlled, American-manufactured military grade sniper bullets and rounds.  Livshits was indicted by the United States District Court, Eastern District of New York, Brooklyn, New York, on December 5, 2022, and a federal warrant was issued for his arrest.\r\n ",

Korshunov’s job was to encourage Western aviation companies to work with UEC to advance Russia’s aviation technology.  He hired engineers employed by a subsidiary of a large United States aviation company to consult on the re-design of the Russian PD-14 aero engine.  Korshunov also allegedly hid UEC’s procurements of Western technology through subsidiaries and partner companies, and was able to acquire the United States aviation company’s confidential, protected, and unique engineering patterns, plans, and procedures for the benefit of Russia.\r\n \r\nKorshunov was indicted by the United States District Court, Southern District of Ohio, Cincinnati, Ohio, on August 21, 2019.\r\n ",

Instead, Arias allegedly withdrew funds to pay personal expenses and wired funds overseas.\r\nOn June 6, 2019, Arias was charged with conspiracy; fraudulent schemes and artifices; money laundering in the first degree; ten counts of theft; two counts of illegal control of an enterprise; forgery; and fraudulent schemes by the Superior Court of the State of Arizona in and for the County of Maricopa, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. On June 10, 2019, Arias was arrested in Kirkland, Washington. On June 13, 2019, Arias was released from custody on bond, and subsequently failed to appear for an extradition hearing. On June 17, 2019, Arias was indicted on the above 17 charges related to the fraud scheme. On June 26, 2019, the King County District Court in King County, Washington, charged Arias with failure to appear, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. On March 19, 2020, Arias was charged federally with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, Phoenix, Arizona, and a warrant was issued for his arrest.\r\n ",

The keys were in the ignition and Ruland’s personal possessions were in the cargo area.\r\nRuland sustained a severe head injury when he was young which required a shunt implant. The initial shunt failed, necessitating a second shunt. The implants required “bilateral burr holes” so the shunts could pass through his skull.

The notes included web addresses for the victims to visit and have their files decrypted.  Upon visiting these web addresses, victims were given the ransom amount demanded and provided a virtual currency address to use to pay the ransom.  If a victim paid the ransom amount, Polyanin provided the decryption key, and the victims then were able to access their files.  If a victim did not pay the ransom, Polyanin typically posted the victims’ exfiltrated data or claimed he sold the exfiltrated data to third parties.

Specifically, conspiring to violate United States sanctions on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (“DPRK” or “North Korea”) by working with an American citizen to illegally provide cryptocurrency and blockchain technology services to the DPRK.\r\n \r\nBeginning in or about early 2018, Cao de Benós, the founder of the “Korean Friendship Association,” a pro-DPRK affinity organization, organized the “Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference” for the benefit of the DPRK.  Cao de Benós allegedly recruited an American cryptocurrency expert to provide services to the DPRK at the Conference and arranged his travel to the DPRK in April of 2019 for this purpose, in violation of United States sanctions.  Cao de Benós allegedly coordinated approval from the DPRK government for the expert's participation in the Conference and continued to conspire afterwards to include holding a second cryptocurrency conference in the DPRK in 2020.  Cao de Benós allegedly took steps in an effort to conceal these activities, and the expert's role in the conspiracy, from United States authorities.  The expert was arrested by United States authorities in November of 2019, disrupting the scheme and the second conference planned for 2020.  At no time did Cao de Benós, or co-conspirator Christopher Douglas Emms, obtain permission from the Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), to provide goods, services, or technology to the DPRK, as is required by law.\r\n \r\nA federal arrest warrant was issued for Cao de Benós in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, New York, New York, on January 27, 2022, after he was charged with Conspiracy to Violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).",

Tan Wee Beng is the director and major shareholder of Wee Tiong (S) Pte Ltd, a Singapore-based commodities trading company.  Over several years, dating back to at least 2011, Tan Wee Beng and others in his company allegedly fulfilled millions of dollars in commodities contracts for North Korea.  To do so, Tan Wee Beng allegedly made a concerted effort to launder money through the United States and Singaporean financial systems by concealing payment origins and structuring transactions to avoid regulator scrutiny.  In some cases, when wire payments were rejected, Tan Wee Beng and Wee Tiong (S) Pte Ltd orchestrated payment in bulk cash, often hand-delivered by North Koreans.  Over this period, Tan Wee Beng and his co-conspirators also allegedly knew of and took efforts to evade financial sanctions.  On August 29, 2018, a federal arrest warrant was issued for Tan Wee Beng in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, New York, New York, after he was charged with conspiracy to violate the IEEPA, bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, money laundering, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and conspiracy to defraud the United States.\r\n.",

Both had recently left from a bar and had been drinking that night. While asleep in the car, the victim was awoken to a knock on the driver door window. The subject at the window identified himself as a police officer and began questioning the two about a possible DUI. The suspect requested the victim’s license, registration and insurance. The victim was directed out of the vehicle and brought to the rear of her car. The victim was further questioned and \"frisked\" on the inside of her legs and breasts. The suspect told the victim that because the keys were in the ignition, she could face a DUI charge. The victim questioned the suspect as to his name and badge number but was told to stop asking or she would be handcuffed and arrested. The suspect directed the victim to come with him to his patrol vehicle to submit to a portable breath test. The suspect walked the victim to a nearby alley where he pushed her against a telephone pole. The suspect first digitally penetrated the victim and then sexually assaulted (penile) her. The victim cried out, which her friend heard, and then the friend called out for her and the suspect ran off. The suspect fled from the assault area on foot.",

The indictment charges 11 defendants, Boris Alekseyevich Antonov, Dmitriy Sergeyevich Badin, Nikolay Yuryevich Kozachek, Aleksey Viktorovich Lukashev, Artem Andreyevich Malyshev, Sergey Aleksandrovich Morgachev, Aleksandr Vladimirovich Osadchuk, Aleksey Aleksandrovich Potemkin, Ivan Sergeyevich Yermakov, Pavel Vyacheslavovich Yershov, and Viktor Borisovich Netyksho, with a computer hacking conspiracy involving gaining unauthorized access into the computers of U.S. persons and entities involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, stealing documents from those computers, and staging releases of the stolen documents to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  The indictment also charges these defendants with aggravated identity theft, false registration of a domain name, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.  Two defendants, Aleksandr Vladimirovich Osadchuk and Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev, are charged with a separate conspiracy to commit computer crimes, relating to hacking into the computers of U.S. persons and entities responsible for the administration of 2016 U.S. elections, such as state boards of elections, secretaries of state, and U.S. companies that supplied software and other technology related to the administration of U.S. elections.  The United States District Court for the District of Columbia in Washington, D.C. issued a federal arrest warrant for each of these defendants upon the grand jury’s return of the indictment.\r\n ",

Pratt also allegedly paid other young women working at his and his co-conspirators' direction to act as references and provide false assurances to the women that, if they filmed a pornographic video, the video would not be posted online. Some women were allegedly not permitted to leave the shooting locations until the videos were completed, others were allegedly forced to perform sex acts they had declined to perform, and some women were allegedly sexually assaulted.

Beginning in approximately 2014, Ignatova and others are alleged to have defrauded billions of dollars from investors all over the world.  Ignatova was the founder of OneCoin Ltd., a Bulgaria-based company that marketed a purported cryptocurrency.  In order to execute the scheme, Ignatova allegedly made false statements and representations to individuals in order to solicit investments in OneCoin.  She allegedly instructed victims to transmit investment funds to OneCoin accounts in order to purchase OneCoin packages, causing victims to send wire transfers representing these investments.  Throughout the scheme, OneCoin is believed to have defrauded victims out of more than $4 billion.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Ignatova served as OneCoin's top leader through October 2017. On October 25, 2017, Ignatova traveled from Sofia, Bulgaria, to Athens, Greece, and may have traveled elsewhere after that.  She may travel on a German passport to the United Arab Emirates, Bulgaria, Germany, Russia, Greece and/or Eastern Europe.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>On October 12, 2017, Ignatova was charged in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York and a federal warrant was issued for her arrest.  On February 6, 2018, a superseding indictment was issued charging Ignatova with one count each of Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud; Wire Fraud; Conspiracy to Commit Money Laundering; Conspiracy to Commit Securities Fraud; and Securities Fraud.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
